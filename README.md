# ch2salesTax
Write a program that computes the total sales tax on a $95 purchase. Assume the state sales tax is 6.5% and the county sales tax is 2%. Display the purchase price, state tax, county tax, and total cost of the purchase. Use spaces in the output between text and numbers to make it look more readable. Start the output with a header like this: "Chapter 2 Sales Tax by Student Name", where "Student Name" should be replaced with your name.  Here is an example of the output, using a purchase price of $10:  Ch 2 Sales Tax  Take a screenshot of the result when the purchase price is $95. Take a screenshot of the result of another execution when the purchase price is a different value (it cannot be $10).     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
